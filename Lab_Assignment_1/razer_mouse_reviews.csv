Chanly Duong,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2025","now for my background, i play r6 and csgo, and occasionally roblox shooters. i went from originally a 60g razer orochi v2 using a fingertip grip, and i went to this mouse with a traditional claw. i‚Äôve had this mouse for a few months and i can say that this is a very good and universal shape for all sorts of grips. i have a medium size hand and i can comfortably fingertip and claw this mouse. the coating is lovely and the best i‚Äôve personally felt on a mouse, and i tried the grips but they eventually wear out over time so i don‚Äôt recommend using those (the actual mouse texture is better than the grips anyway). now i know this sounds a little ridiculous but moving from a 60g small mouse not even including the batteries, i played a LOT better with this bigger one after adjusting and i‚Äôm honestly happy with my purchase (even though it cost quite a bit). it feels light in the hand for the size and the weight is flawlessly distributed. the skates are solid for being stock but you can always upgrade, the scroll wheel is pretty normal and has distinctive bumps per scroll but personally i like more smoother ones (this is just my own subjective opinion and i am probably just being nitpicky). the main clicks are lovely to hear and the little dongle included doesn‚Äôt take up too much space, i‚Äôd say only the actual cable itself does but this isn‚Äôt actually an issue. the dongle can also support up to 8k hz which isn‚Äôt necessary but it‚Äôs a ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù feature and i use 2k hz myself to save battery life; speaking of battery life it‚Äôs pretty good and i suggest not using 8k since it drains it pretty fast (just remember to plug it in after use) also, the side buttons are a DEFINITE improvement from my old mouse and that was a perfect feature on the mouse. now, razer‚Äôs synapse software can be a little finicky sometimes but i suggest just configuring your settings and uninstalling it since it can take up some of your ram and overall performance. in conclusion, this is a really good option for gaming mice and it can fit a LOT of playstyles. this has all of the latest mouse tech (might be a little outdated for me to be saying that in the big 25 now) and each part of the mouse is very pleasant to use. i suggest this mouse if you have the money (it is pretty ehh value for money but as long as you have the funds it‚Äôs a s tier mouse)"
KCR1990,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2025","So far it's been well worth the money, it's so light it feels hollow.

Battery life so far has been very good but I haven't used a wireless mouse in a long time so have nothing to compare it to.

I did game two days 6-8 hours and it's at 78% now.

It's good a good simplistic look, really simple and solid mouse. Hopefully it holds up overall, every razer mouse I've bought eventually gets double click after a few years which make them unusable."
Gregory,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2024","TL;DR this mouse is my overall favorite pick right now:

1. Great sensor
2. Great mouse switches
3. Easy to click buttons including mouse wheel -- major selling point for me
4. Can be used wired while charging

Notes:

First thing, I hate the shape. But I can still kind of work with it. I prefer higher profile mice and more of a palm grip and it seems razer is generally more known for their claw grip mice. As a reference my favorite mouse shape is the Logitech MX Master 3S, which I could never use for gaming but it's a great work mouse.

However, the shape is not totally uncomfortable and I can still work with it.

The sensor feels great. I've been testing lots of mice recently and as soon as I switched to the Viper V3 pro I could instantly feel my aim improve. It sounds like utter nonsense but it does somehow feel a bit ""smoother"" to work with. It may be entirely mental but it's strange that I could feel the difference after working with another mouse for 2 whole weeks.

The mouse clicks feel great and the wheel is very easy to click.
The left/right buttons don't have a very far travel distance which makes it very easy to click quickly.

Other mice comparison:

I was originally comparing this to the Pulsar Xlite V3 which has a shape that I love but the Pulsar's mouse wheel is way too hard to click. Since I use the middle mouse button for pinging enemies in FPS it's a huge problem not to be able to reliably click the wheel in a pinch situation.

Other mice I compared this with are the Logitech G Pro X and Razer Naga Pro.
All the razer mice seem to have very easy to click switches all around (including the wheel).

The mouse wheel button was much harder to press on Logitech and Pulsar mice. Again this mouse wheel thing is really only an issue if you're using it in competitive gaming where you really need reliability and ease of use more than anything. If you're playing casually maybe it's not as important."
Mordant,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025","I am quite annoyed by buggy, inconsistent input devices. So understand this review in context.

This mouse is feather light, so there is very little effort in moving it around. The feet are very slick, pushing even further into no effort territory. I paired it with a low drag mouse pad and found oout that I might have gone a little too far. At that point, without the drag of a cable or significant friction, the thing would move without intent. I would take my hand off it tl do something like visit the kitchen and come back to find that something as minor as my own movements leaving the desk, for example, would cause it to move the cursor across the screen. It sounds bad, but I have to be honest and say that I love it. Battery life seems great. I have only had to charge it less than once per week (maybe less).

If I had to find a very minor flaw, I guess it would be that a quiet room will accentuate the somewhat pingy mouse button sound. But I have to be clear, this is the most nitpicky issue I could identify. Simply put, I have ZERO complaints about this mouse. It's a little expensive but you are definitely getting what you pay for."
Chris,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024","Not a big Razer fan, but I was getting sick of another company's terrible iCue software. This mouse has a great shape that fits my hand perfect. It's lightweight. It supports 8K poling rate which lowers input lag. I am still not sold that it is actually 8K like my wired mouse is, but I can feel the difference between the 1K and 8K setting for this mouse.

The only gripe that I have is that the Synapse software keeps losing games from the profiles that I setup. I add a game, set everything up, and then after restarting my computer the game is no longer linked to the profile. Really frustrating. I only knocked 1 star off for this though, because the mouse is great in every other way."
Goksenin,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025","I‚Äôve been using the Razer Viper V3 Pro for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs easily one of the best wireless gaming mice I‚Äôve ever used. As someone who plays competitive FPS games, I was looking for something lightweight, responsive, and comfortable, and this mouse delivers on all fronts.

üñ±Ô∏è Design & Comfort ‚Äì Feels Great in Hand
At just 54 grams, this mouse is super lightweight without feeling flimsy. Its shape is similar to the Logitech G Pro X Superlight, but with a slightly flared back, it feels more comfortable for claw and fingertip grips. It‚Äôs easy to flick and aim, and I haven‚Äôt experienced any fatigue after long gaming sessions.

üéØ Performance ‚Äì Insanely Precise & Responsive
The 35K DPI optical sensor is ridiculously accurate, and the tracking feels smooth. I also tried the 8K polling rate, and while it‚Äôs great on paper, the difference isn‚Äôt super noticeable in real-world gameplay (but it‚Äôs nice to have for future-proofing). Clicks feel crisp, and the Gen3 optical switches are fast and satisfying.

üîã Battery Life ‚Äì No Complaints
Battery life has been fantastic‚ÄîI get 90+ hours on a full charge, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about constantly recharging. It comes with a SpeedFlex charging cable, which is excellent if you ever need to use it wired.

‚ö†Ô∏è Anything to Watch For?
It‚Äôs expensive, but it‚Äôs worth the price for serious competitive gamers.
There are no RGB or extra features, but I prefer the clean, minimalistic look.
‚úÖ Final Verdict ‚Äì Worth Every Penny for Competitive Players!
If you‚Äôre looking for a super lightweight, fast, and accurate gaming mouse, the Viper V3 Pro is one of the best options. It‚Äôs perfect for FPS games, has incredible battery life, and feels great in hand. It‚Äôs worth the upgrade if you want an edge in competitive play!

‚≠ê Rating: 9.5/10 ‚Äì Ultra-light, ultra-fast, and ultra-reliable. Highly recommended!"

Krave,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024","This is by far the best mouse I‚Äôve ever owned, and I‚Äôve owned several, including the Razer DeathAdder, Mamba, Mamba Elite, and most recently, the SteelSeries Aerox 5 Wireless. I switched to this mouse because the scroll wheel on the Aerox breaks far too quickly. Initially, I was hesitant to get the Viper due to the Aerox 5's five side buttons but I‚Äôm so glad I made the switch!

This mouse is incredible. The response speeds are super fast, it‚Äôs insanely light, and it glides effortlessly across my mouse pad. The battery life is also outstanding. I used it for four days straight before putting it on the charger as I was going to bed, and it still had 37% left. Switching between wired and wireless modes is instant, which is a huge improvement over my Aerox 5, where connections sometimes took minutes. The scroll wheel feels high quality and has deep notches.

I‚Äôm not sure why I see people hating on Razer Synapse. Maybe I'm a little biased since I've always used razer keyboards, and am Using the Huntsman pro rn but I've never had issue and I always found it pretty convenient for making macros and chroma effects and the features Synapse has for this mouse is pretty Dope. For example, you can create your own sensitivity response curve, similar to how controller settings work in many games. Additionally, if you grip your mouse at an angle, as I do with a left leaning grip, you can tell Synapse your grip style using a slider for better horizontal accuracy. You can also have synapse auto switch polling rates depending on if your in a fullscreen game or just browsing the web which makes the battery last ages. I use 2000hz in-game and 1000hz out.

Overall, I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but this mouse has me blown away. It‚Äôs significantly better than my previous one in every way. Highly recommend it to anyone considering an upgrade or looking for a premium wireless mouse. For real this thing is AWESOME."
Mr. Next Level,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025","I've had the Razer Viper V3 Pro for a while now, and I must say it is absolutely fantastic to use. Weighing in at 54 grams, the mouse strikes an excellent balance that enhances gameplay without feeling cumbersome. I primarily play first-person shooters like Destiny 2, Call of Duty, Killing floor 2 and The Finals, but it's been great on all types of games and I can comfortably game for long sessions with excellent accuracy.

One feature I truly appreciate is the grip tape that comes included in the packaging. I applied it immediately, and it elevates the overall comfort level, providing a secure grip during intense gaming moments. The build quality is impressive with great durability and reliability.

The 8k polling rate dongle is a brilliant addition, delivering a solid signal with virtually no latency. Transitioning between 4k and 8k polling rates is seamless, and I‚Äôve noticed exceptional accuracy in my movements. The Razer Synapse software complements the hardware perfectly, offering a plethora of customization options. From adjusting DPI settings to monitoring power usage, the software enhances the overall experience and makes it easy to tailor the mouse to my preferences.

Overall, this mouse is a fantastic package from Razer. It‚Äôs become my new favorite, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-performance gaming mouse. Whether you‚Äôre a casual gamer or a competitive player, the Razer Viper V3 Pro is sure to impress."
Jared,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2025","Really like this mouse. Bought this after my Logitech G Pro Mouse started having issues - wheel started to slide - bottom got roughed up where it left marks on mouse pad.

This mouse has a tabletop connection that I can use to charge the mouse when needed so it does not take up my 1 usb port I have on my keyboard.

- Fits good in hand
- Mouse wheel feels solid
- Like table top connection that allow me to use cord when ready to charge
- Weight is perfect
- Bottom does not seem it will get messed up like my Logitech G Pro"
Bean,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2025","Coming from a GPX Superlight, I was hesitant at first to get this mouse due to the very similar shapes that the two mice had, and my previous experience with Razer products was not so good. I decided to pull the trigger, and I have to say that the Viper V3 Pro feels very light and amazing, the coating is super grippy. The clicks and side buttons are light and responsive. It's the best iteration of the Viper line, and the best mouse that I have tried.
However, my product came with a defective USB cable, ""malfunctioned device"" notification kept popping up on my PC, so I could not use it in wired mode, despite it being able to charge normally. Although I mentioned how good the coating was, I started to notice some paint chips all over my hands after a gaming session, I might be nitpicking but it was very annoying to me. I decided to return the product, and get a new one."
KJ,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2024","I finally broke my GPX and needed a replacement same-day. This was my only option--and I don't regret it all. This mouse is essentially the same weight and shape, but with better side buttons (size & tactile feel are way better) and a better scroll wheel. Those were my only two complaints with the logitech GPX superlight. The shape is slightly different in a way that I can't describe well but most people seem to agree is more comfortable.

I am using this without the Razer software for now. It defaults to 1600 dpi and that is what I want, but it can toggle to 800, 3200, etc. with just the mouse power button. I am not sure if the default polling rate is 8000 hz, but I don't think I'd notice much difference between 1000 and 8000, except for battery life. I've used Razer's software suite before and although it's not the worst on the market, I'd rather not put it on my PC. I'm glad this mouse seems to meet my needs without any software for now.

Other nice bonuses are the included mouse tape and the all white dongle/cable. Nice touches that logitech didn't think to include with the original superlight.

Overall, highly recommend this mouse as a top-of-the-line improvement on the much-loved GPX. The price is a little steep but for me it may be the perfect mouse."
JPlayzGames,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2025","What can I say other than this mouse is perfect if you're into fps shooters. 0 issues with wireless connectivity. It's a great value for the money.

I did swap the skates on it for glass skates and for an extra $10 it made this mouse 10000x better"
Kalvin,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2025","Super lightweight, feels great in hand, and the wireless connection is smooth‚Äîno lag. The clicks are nice and crisp, and the DPI adjustments are easy. Perfect for gaming or just everyday use. If you need a reliable, fast mouse, this one‚Äôs worth checking out."
Joe,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024","‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
If you‚Äôre on the fence between the GPX 2 and Viper V3 Pro, then let me help you decide. I own both white versions and I‚Äôve got the deets:
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Weight: Viper V3 Pro - it‚Äôs somewhat noticeably lighter and easier to maneuver. Not a whole bunch, but yeah.

Sensor: Viper V3 Pro - Not a huge difference, but it seems a bit snappier and does have 8k polling for future proofing. Max 2-4K is all you‚Äôll really need tho.

Clicks: GPX2 - the viper‚Äôs are lighter and snappier, with less noise out of the box. But once you burn in the GPX2‚Äôs, the clicks are pretty much perfect, if not still bizarrely loud for a gaming mouse. But the viper‚Äôs are so light I found myself accidentally triggering them when making fast movements.

Side buttons: Viper v3 pro - much better than the GPX2, not mushy in the slightest.

Build quality: Tie - they‚Äôre both solid.

Dongle/Cable: GPX 2 - it‚Äôs not paracord, but it actually can be used with other usb cables and doesn‚Äôt limit your desk options. 8k isn‚Äôt a saving grace here. It‚Äôs also more versatile location-wise (you can plug the dongle into a usb port).

Shape: Viper V3 Pro (subjective) - I feel that the viper v3‚Äôs shape, while similar to the GPx2, is slightly better balanced and has better placement for my pinky and ring finger.

Scroll Wheel: Viper v3 pro - the GPX‚Äôs scroll wheel is bad. It feels bad, it looks bad, it clicks bad. I‚Äôm tired of pretending like it‚Äôs remotely okay for 160 bucks.

OEM Skates: Viper V3 Pro - The GPX 2‚Äôs stock PTFE skates are awful. They are somehow scratchy and muddy all in one. Immediately replace them.

Coating: GPX2 - Its coating is slightly better, feels more present IMO. I could be hallucinating‚Ä¶

Price: GPX 2 - It‚Äôs cheaper and not a whole lot worse. It‚Äôs a classic choice and you won‚Äôt go wrong with it.

Software: Viper V3 Pro - Razer by a mile. Synapse actually works, Ghub is god awful.

Battery Life: GPX 2 - much better battery life, especially at 4K polling. You‚Äôll plug in the V3 pro almost twice as much, which isn‚Äôt really much of a problem.

Quality of life: Viper V3 Pro - Shuts off automatically, don‚Äôt need to flick a switch or unplug anything. Has LEDs that display battery level. Has a dpi shift button on the bottom.

Overall, Razer‚Äôs made the better gaming mouse here, but it‚Äôs not a massive upgrade from the GPX2. If you‚Äôre not a Logitech diehard, you‚Äôll acclimate to Razer‚Äôs new mouse pretty quickly. Perchance."
Chris,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025","Lightning fast mouse. My first and only razer product coming from a Logitech superlight and much prefer this mouse. Fits a lot nicer in my slightly larger hands. It‚Äôs nice looking, one of the lightest mice on the market and battery life is good as long as you don‚Äôt crank the polling rate. Buy it!"
twinturbonet,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2025","Great gaming mouse! Lightweight, wheel mouse scrolls nicely, very subtle design with no wild flair or anything like that. Perfect for my gaming needs and daily browsing needs."

Brian,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025",I had the Logitech super lite and the side mouse button seized up. So I went and upgraded to the razer. So far I like the razer better than the super lite. Can‚Äôt speak for the new super lite 2 though since I went with the razer. And I like the stick on grip better than the one on the super lite. Get the razer if youre thinking about getting it coming from a logitech super lite.
Edward Fernandez,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2025","The side buttons are so responsive.

castel gelin,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025","Super light, comes with grip tape. You can increase DPI up and down by increments of one, which really helps in games with lackluster sensitivity sliders.

The Lovely Lyss,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2024","As someone who loves the Superlight and has been jamming out with version 2 of it along with a Logitech Pro X TKL paired with it, it's been nice to swap back to my Black Widow V4 along with the Viper Pro 3.

Right out of the box, and I am someone with medium to large hands, this mouse is just a pure delight to hold; it's not often I can say that my hands feel like they disappear when using a peripheral, but this mouse and the Superlight from Logi are the two mice that achieve that for me. Razer knew what they were doing here and it shows in the product; this will be my go-to mouse and I will alternate my Razer setup back to the Logitech set up as the mood strikes me to change things up week by week.

When it comes time for the Wooting 80HE to arrive, I will most likely be pairing the Viper Pro 3 with that board due to just how consistently good it feels; I am 3 hours deep into a play session and the battery is down to 98% and I'm using the 4K polling rate; not going to bother with 8K just yet.

It's hard to put into words here just how good the slight ergo shape of this mouse feels; I really have tried a number of different mice and this could be ""the one""; I don't say this in a hyperbolic fashion either. It's rare that you use a gaming device where you just forget what you're using because it seamlessly blends into the play session.

For anyone looking to try this out, the asking price is steep. For a low frills mouse in the aesthetic department it really isn't going to be winning wards for it's design change to be not as sharp as it's predecessor. I for one really dig the smoother design and the light hump towards the back of the mouse, the finger ridges, or whatever you want to call them, on the L + R mouse clicks, all come together to suit whatever combination of grip you want to employ here. I am using a light palm grip and find that going claw and then relaxing my fingers feel natural.

The side buttons deserve a special award here; they are separated ever so slightly and their clicks are immediate / responsive. Truly the only gripe I have with my Superlight are the side buttons; Logitech really needs to take the oatmeal mush out of those and it will be a near perfect mouse for me.

Really curious to see what kind of competition this will spur with other manufacturers; that said, and for now, this is the best of the best for something that is here, on Amazon, that you can order and have by tomorrow while it's in stock. To whoever nabs one, enjoy; curious to see other reviews pop up on here."

Rosa DeLuca,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2024","I‚Äôve had a Logitech g pro superlight for two years and the gpx2 since it came out. The shapes are very very very similar. Almost identical. The viper is more flared at the bottom back while the gpx is narrower. The main difference is where your aiming and shooting fingers sit, the viper is more downward. In the front of the mouse, the viper feels more narrow. Anyone that says a gpx is not similar is trying to be a rebel or doesn‚Äôt own both.

The viper is Also better quality when squeezing. There is absolutely no give. My gpx2 makes a little creak sound when I do that. I‚Äôve also owned the viper v2 pro ultimate. It is a totally different mouse from this. That is why YouTubers are mostly comparing it to the gpro series.

8k and 4k polling is a lie to the eye, you won‚Äôt be able to tell the difference between those and 1k. On paper it‚Äôs great but in person you would need a slow motion camera to tell. 8k polling can also cause stuttering issues. This is just my experience, maybe some people can tell but I doubt it.

In comparison to the gpx2, the viper Side buttons are better along with the coating. The g pro is slippery and the viper feels similar but is way more grippy for some reason.

I still like the gpx2 clicks and scroll wheel. Not sure about battery life, haven‚Äôt had it long enough. Both of the scroll wheels on each mouse can be clicked from the side. The side buttons on the viper put the Gpx to shame. If you own a gpx, you know what I‚Äôm talking about.

The viper v3 pro is also lighter. I‚Äôll get some superglide skates when they come out for it. If you have the gpx2 or 1, you‚Äôll love it. If you have the viper v2 pro, it‚Äôs hard to say because it‚Äôs a bold change but a familiar shape if you are coming from the gpx.

I still like the gpx more but the viper came very close to taking the crown. The viper is a better mouse in almost every metric but the gpx shape is undefeated in my opinion. If you didn‚Äôt like the gpx but want something similar in shape, this is a contender.

Update: I‚Äôve been using the viper as my main with hundreds of hours on it. It will take some time to get used to if you are coming from a g pro. but again, it‚Äôs not that large of a change. The coating has stood the test of time and if you hate razers software, then just save the profile to the mouse and delete the software. If Logitech begins to innovate again and come out with a g pro 3 superlight then I‚Äôll get it but they haven‚Äôt done so."

Brandon,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025","Best mouse I've used. I was mained a G Pro x Superlight for 2 years and it was a great mouse, but this one is better in every way possible. I highly recommend!!!"
JeffreyK,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024","The mouse is good. The shape works for me. A lot of people compare it to the Gpro Superlight, but in my opinion, it's different enough to be a different mouse. It's not super different but it is enough to give me a different experience with grip.

I have both mice, and this one is more comfortable and easy to control for me. The back of the mouse has this flat surface that requires me to claw my finger to contact the back. The hump is same height as Gpro height but looks placed more towards the back than the front. With my grip, the hump doesn't contact my palm, it contacts more of my palm knuckle area. It's probably of the way I grip the mouse.

The mouse fits much better for my grip style. Especially because the side slant/groove is more emphasized than on the Gpro. The Gpro barely has a noticeable side groove which makes it slightly janky and wobbly when I grip it. I guess with palm grip the Gpro would be comfortable but I don't do a palm grip.
The side slant/groove gives me a lot of control on the mouse. The grip tape that came with it helps a lot and I also place extra grip tape on the mouse back using Razer universal grip tape."
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2024","The Build of the mouse feels great. Basically zero complaints for build quality on this mouse. The value for money of this mouse comes out in the small details. It has great functionality, you could say maybe a lot more than you expect? The Battery life is actually great. If you game for Long amounts of time it should be fine. Buttons are straight forward. They feel fine. I truly DO NOT have any issues or concerns with them. Nothing stands out with the buttons but in a good way. This Is a Wireless Mouse, so the Gaming Capability is exactly what you pay for. I purchased the White Version and I have nothing negative to comment about this mouse. I would recommend this. If you have smaller hands it may be a bit uncomfortable. That being said, I'd still recommend this mouse."

LAdude,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024","After doing quite a bit of research, the Razer Viper V3 Pro was one of the highest rated gaming mice available. I was initially impressed with functionality while plugged in. This very expensive mouse feels well built and tracking was extremely precise and smooth. As soon as charging was complete, I connected the ""HyperPolling"" dongle, and the mouse randomly stopped responding. If I moved the adapter close to the mouse, it worked well, but then it interfered with my wireless keyboard. Unlike most other mice, you can't just plug in a small USB adapter and be good to go, but rather you have a 3 foot long cord with a heavy receiver dongle. Traveling with this mouse can be a challenge, especially used with a laptop. If you want to charge the mouse, the dongle must be unplugged and set aside. Razer Synapse software is not great and perhaps was causing some of the glitches.

Being used to large mice like the Logitech G703, I was expecting this to be a very comfortable mouse, but the contours are not as good. I also felt that the clicks were dampened compared to the reassuring clicks on the Logitech. I can definitely see why this is such a highly rated mouse, but the dongle issue combined with random interference issues proved it was not the mouse for me. There needs to be more right handed mice with larger palm grips."

Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2024",Pretty light and fast. Battery life is also good. I don't like the back part of the mouse its not as comfortable.
Alexander Perez,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025","Yeah it's pricy but its safe to say that it's that good, ultra light, absolutely no lag, perfect tracking, includes very effective grip tape & battery life is pretty darn good."

Justin,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024","This mouse is great in every aspect but the battery life. It‚Äôs advertised at 95 hours of battery at 1000 polling rate but it‚Äôs realistically more like 70 hours. Might not be an extreme deal breaker for others, but the fact that the mouse barely lasts a week at 1000 Hz is atrocious in my opinion for a $160 mouse."
Josh,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2024","The mouse has really nice clicks and amazing side buttons, the best I've used, and I've used lots of other high-end mice like the Razer Viper Ultimate and V2 pro, Logitech GPro Wireless, Superlight 1, and 2, and mouses from Lamzu and Pulsar. For me the mouse's coating is not very good it picks up oils which makes it slip but this can be fixed with grip tape which I don't like using, but decided to use for this mouse which made it better. Also, the mouse's scroll wheel button resistance is too low that when scrolling it registers the middle mouse button being clicked in the game only not when just casually browsing the web. But all in all, I do recommend the mouse if you want a better review of the mouse look up a YouTube video from boardzy."
